Fractal's Latest Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Introduction
==============

Welcome to The Fractal Deployment Doc, where you can find information and guides to help you learn about Fractal and
start exploring its features. Fractal is dedicated to providing a high performance and energy-efficient blockchain
platform, and supporting a wide variety of decentralized applications. The Fractal Chain helps you write
commercial-scale DApps, it provides secure scalability solutions to handle 1,000x more transactions than
legacy blockchain with near-instant finality.

Why Fractal Platform
----------------------
- `Built-in Security <https://www.fractalblock.com/>`_ Fractal is powered by iChing, a Bitcoin-like proof-of-stake consensus protocol with rigorous security proof and post-quantum guarantee. The protocol enables large-scale networks with millFractal is powered by iChing, a Bitcoin-like proof-of-stake consensus protocol with rigorous security proof and post-quantum guarantee. The protocol enables large-scale networks with millions of miners, thus, guarantees a truly decentralized blockchain.ions of miners, thus, guarantees a truly decentralized blockchain.
- `Scalability <https://www.fractalblock.com/>`_ On top of the iChing consensus, Fractal has a multi-level of performance amplification for achieving scalability. First, an extended consensus has been developed by utilizing the structure of iChing. Second, iChing is a natural mimic of Bitcoin consensus; as a result, scalability solutions for Bitcoin can be immediately used in Fractal. Altogether, Fractal can securely process 1,000x times more transactions comparing to legacy blockchains.
- `Compatibility <https://www.fractalblock.com/>`_ Fractal, with modular and composable design, will support a wide range of dApps. Further, regulation will be enforced so that dApps can safely interact and exchange services with each other as well as many dApps on other ecosystems whether they are public or private.

Who This Deployment Doc Is For
---------------------------
This doc is for those who wants to start using fractal node for mining, to test deploy a smart contract, manage accounts and
to send transactions.


How to Use this Doc
--------------------
Please read the doc in sequence. Later chapters build on concepts from earlier chapters. Although we typically revisit
the topics later, earlier chapters might not delve into details on a specific topic.

Youâ€™ll find three chapters in this Doc:

- `Getting Started <guides/getting_started.html>`_  is a quick start to install Fractal, and deploy a node on ``PrivateNetwork`` and ``TestNetwork``.

- `How To Guides <guides/how_to_guide.html>`_ looks into details on the bash script from `Getting Started <guides/getting_started.html>`_. It introduces how to start a PrivateNetwork or TestNetwork step by step, how to start mining, send a transaction and how to deploy a smart contract.

- `Usage <guides/usage.html>`_ is the cli command reference page.
